# Project_SpamFilter

This project creates a spam filter that classifies new messages as spam or not. The initial idea is to ensure that 80% of new messages are correctly classified as spam or ham(non-spam). For this, the Naive Bayes multinomial algorithm is used together with a dataset of 5,572 SMS messages previously classified by humans.
