# Project_SpamFilter

In this project, we're going to create a spam filter that classifies new messages with an accuracy greater than 80% â€” so we expect that more than 80% of the new messages will be classified correctly as spam or ham(non-spam). To do that, we'll use the multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm along with a dataset of 5,572 SMS messages that are already classified by humans.
